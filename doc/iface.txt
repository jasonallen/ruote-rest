note : the URIs are generic.


== high-level process instance manipulation

POST /processes                   
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/processes"
  body : launchitem representation
  launches new process instance

PUT /processes/:wfid
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/process"
  body : mini process representation
  update (pause/resume) process instance

DELETE /processes/:wfid
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/process"
  body : none
  cancel/abort process instance


== incoming workitems

This is not "worklist" bound. An engine with no worklist would present this resource anyway.

POST /workitems
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/workitems"
  body : a workitem
  participant may post back an updated workitem here directly

supplement : this resource could accept launchitems as well


== low-level process instance manipulation

PUT /expressions/:wfid/:expid
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/process/expression"
  body : expression representation (YAML)
  updates an expression (mostly its branch of the AST)

PUT /expressions/:wfid/:expid/tree
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/process/expression/tree"
  body : expression tree as JSON
  updates an expression (mostly its branch of the AST)

DELETE /expressions/:wfid/:expid/tree
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/process/expression"
  body : none
  cancels an expression (its branch of the process instance)

(
POST /expressions/:wfid/:expid
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/process/expression"
  body : none
  re-applies the expression
)


== error management

DELETE /errors/:wfid/:expid
POST /errors/:wfid/:expid
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/process/error"
  body : none or workitem or workitem payload (hash)
  replays the process instance at the error [point]


== participant management

(not sure about this one, not really keen on doing participant management over HTTP)

POST /participants
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/participants"
  body : participant id + participant parameters
  registers a participant in the engine

DELETE /participants/:pid
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/participant"
  body : none
  de-registers a participant from the engine


== worklist management

PUT /workitems/:wfid/:expid
  rel="http://openwfe.org/rels/workitem"
  body : workitem
  updates or updates + proceeds workitem

what about PUT for update and POST for proceed ?
